onboarding 0 - create and earn health token
onboarding 1 - put it after 1

drop the descriptions in Health Handler, website and anywhere coz ppl dont like creating those nor reading

new screens:
1) create meal - based on https://handler.health/create-meal
2) create plan - based on https://handler.health/create-plan

link the new screens in the dashboard

making the chart would be a lot of effort

two 'chart' screens => get rid of one with the chart, keep one with the raised so far, add something else
